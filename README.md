# IPL-Winner-Prediction

We are going to discuss the IPL team win prediction. Data is accessed by the computer programs developed using Machine learning to build models. The algorithm first analyses the data to create a model, specifically for understanding the patterns or trends. To extract actionable patterns and detailed statistics, the parameters are then fed into the dataset. The dataset is loaded and a set of pre-processing is done followed by feature selection. We are using two datasets, namely, matches and deliveries which give us details about matches conducted, winners of the match, runs per ball of each match and many more. Our machine learning model for the project will have both a classification and a probabilistic approach. The machine learning algorithm Logistic Regression is applied for our project. Then it is applied to predict the winner and visualizes the results as graphs. Our model is also capable of determining the probability of the winner per ball. So, in this project we will predict the probability of who will be the winner of an IPL match.
